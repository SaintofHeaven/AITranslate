# AITranslate
Welcome to AITranslate, an application that leverages the power of GPT-4 API to seamlessly translate text from any spoken language to any language supported by GPT-4.

## Introduction

AITranslate aims to provide a user-friendly interface for translating text with the help of cutting-edge language processing technology. With GPT-4 at its core, AITranslate offers accurate and contextually relevant translations, making it a versatile tool for communication across languages.

## Features

**Translation Capabilities:** Translate text from a GPT-4 compatible language to any other language supported.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy input and output of text translations.

**Scalable Architecture**: Built with scalability in mind to handle a large volume of translation requests efficiently.

**Future Enhancements**: Planned integration of custom language models to further enhance translation accuracy and capabilities.

## Usage

To use AITranslate, simply input the text you want to translate and select the desired source and target languages. The application will then utilize the GPT-4 API to generate the translation.

**AITranslate is currently under development. Stay tuned for updates on installation instructions once the client-side code and backend framework are available.**

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve AITranslate. Whether it's through code contributions, bug fixes, or feature suggestions, your input is valuable in making AITranslate a better tool for language translation.

## Roadmap

**Client Side Development**: Complete the development of the client-side code for AITranslate.

**Backend Framework**: Build a robust backend framework to efficiently process queries and API requests.

**Custom Language Model**: Research and development of a custom NLP model to supplement AITranslate and enhance translation capabilities.
